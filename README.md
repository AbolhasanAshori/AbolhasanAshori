# 🙂 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Abolhasan Ashori, a passionate developer who has dedicated the last few years
to exploring the world of programming, or as I like to call it, 'The Power of Creation.'
I am completely fascinated by the endless possibilities it offers.

My programming journey began with C/C++, often referred to as 'The Godfather of Modern Programming Languages,'
during my time in college. I then ventured into Java, which may be a bit slow, but I absolutely love it! ❤️
I also delved into the Spring framework for a year. Subsequently, I transitioned to C# and ASP.Net Core,
thinking of it as 'Java, but easier,' and focused on back-end programming.

Currently, I'm a front-end developer specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript, the dynamic duo! 😎
I'm particularly fond of React and NextJS, actively honing my skills in these technologies
and seeking ways to improve them further.

### 📜 Motto
> "Strive to Thrive"

## 🔧 Technologies

```javascript
const languages = ['JavaScript', 'TypeScript'];
const frameworks = ['React', 'NextJS']; // I know 'React' is not a framework
const stateManagers = ['TanStack Query', 'Recoil'];
const testings = ['Storybook'];
const UI = ['MUI', 'Chakra', 'Mantine', 'bootstrap', 'Headless UI'];
const animations = ['react-transition-group', 'Framer Motion', 'Swiper', 'Lottie'];
const development = ['Prettier', 'ESLint', 'Lint Staged', 'Commit lint']
const other = ['leaflet', 'TanStack Table', 'i18next', 'ChartJS']
const skills = ['Responsive Design']
```
