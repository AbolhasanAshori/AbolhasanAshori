## 🙂 About Me

Hi there! 👋 I'm Abolhasan Ashori, a passionate developer who has dedicated the last few years
to exploring the world of programming, or as I like to call it, 'The Power of Creation'.
I am completely fascinated by the endless possibilities it offers.

My programming journey began with C/C++, which I like to call 'The Godfather of Modern Programming Languages.'
during my time in college. I then ventured into Java, which may be a bit slow, but I absolutely love it! ❤️
I also delved into the Spring framework for a year. Subsequently, I transitioned to C# and ASP.Net Core,
thinking of it as 'Java, but easier,' and focused on back-end programming.

Currently, I'm a front-end developer specializing in JavaScript/TypeScript, the dynamic duo! 😎
I'm particularly fond of React and NextJS, actively honing my skills in these technologies
and seeking ways to improve them further.

### 📜 Motto

> "Strive to Thrive"
